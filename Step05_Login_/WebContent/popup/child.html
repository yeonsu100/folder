<p>Itâ€™s a special magic at Christmastime this year.
Hearts are gay and merry, and full of yuletide cheer!
The sprit of the season will make our dreams come true.
Memories of Christmas are here for me and you.
With caroling, bells ring-a-ling,
And Santa Claus will always be
Part of Christmas fantasy.
On this special holiday,
Old Saint Nick will load his sleigh.
Santa always finds his way
In a Christmas fantasy.
Children sing a bright encore,
Counting presents and keeping score.
No one sleeps the night before
A Christmas fantasy!
The spirit of the season will make our dreams come true.
Memories of Christmas are here for me and you!
With caroling, bells ring-a-ling,
And Santa Claus will always be
Part of Christmas fantasy.</p>
